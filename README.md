# SiteTranslationProject
Scraper primarily for scraping whole websites in order to later translate them, but can be used for other purposes as well.

Links are loaded via https://www.textise.net/ to get their text-only versions. All you need to do is provide the Xpath of the element you want to scrape (use right click -> inspect element).

NOTE: If you want to scrape/translate whole websites, please use https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ to easily get all its links.
